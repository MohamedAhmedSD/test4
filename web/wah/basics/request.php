//* Request=> Get, Post

//? get Â : less secure so use it with reading data (select)
//! post : hide, more secure so we use it with insert & update data

//* extension: thunder client or use postman

//* on my browser go to php file then add
// ?param=value&p2=v2&p3=v3
// ?name=btoo&age=10&email=btoo@gmail.com
//! we see we can call one or more param with or without orders

//? =============================================================

//? $_GET
// ["a key of Get"]
$name = $_GET['name'];//? what we write on browser is between []
$age = $_GET['age'];
$email = $_GET['email'];
$phone = $_GET["phone"];
